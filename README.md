### My Shiny App:

## **Customer Value & Segmentation** :shopping: :handbag: :dress: :moneybag: :credit_card: :shopping_cart:

Because of increased retail competition (particularly on-line) and increased pricing pressure (more sales, more coupons), retailers can no longer rely on traditional product selling to determine the success of their business. Instead, retailers are turning to customer information to find out who their best customers are, what they are spending, and what they are buying. My Shiny app looks at customer data from a global fashion retailer, specifically the customer's frequency of transactions and how that translates into the value of the customer. 

The app: 
  - Segments the customers into 4 groups: New, Retained New, Retained Existing, and Reactivated
  - Across all retail channels (luxury, mainline, and ecommerce)
  - Down to the store level
  - Covering the 52 weeks ending June 2020 (analysis time window)
